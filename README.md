### Intro

This is my NHL Expected Goals model project. The project is a Python Machine Learning project that predicts the probability that a given NHL shot will result in a goal. This repo also contains various data analysis programs to draw conclusions from the data. I especially do work visualizing the data in a way that makes the overwhelming amount of data easy to understand.

### What are Expected Goals
In simple terms, an expected goal is the probability that a shot attempt results in a goal. Expected goals, in essence, measure the quality of shot attempts. Expected goal values range from 0 to 1, with 0 being the smallest chance that shot will result in a goal and 1 being the largest chance that a shot will result in a goal. Expected Goals are a very useful metric for both player and team evaluation. Expected Goals are particularly useful because they add context to shots. Instead of all shots being weighed equally, shots are weighed by many different attributes, such as distance, angle, etc. The different factors allow us to get a better idea of the quality of each shot. In a very simple example, if a player takes a wrist shot from 80 feet away, it's safe to assume that this shot is of lower quality than one taken 5 feet away from the net.

### Data Source
The data from this project is scraped from the hockey-scraper Python module. This module allows us to scrape NHL play-by-play data from the 2007 season and on. I used the scrpaer to scrape data from 2010-2022 to save some space. Note that I am still wroking on uploading the scraped data, as I can't jsut put it right in the repo since it's too large.
