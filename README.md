### About

This is my NHL Expected Goals model project. The proejct is a Python Machine Leanring project that predicts the probabilty that a given NHL shot will result in a goal. This repo also contains various data analyiss programs to draw conclusions from the data. I espically do work visualizing the data in a way that makes the overwheling amnount of data easy to understand.
